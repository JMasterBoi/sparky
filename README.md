# Sparky | Control your day, don't let it control you

** Sparky is a platform that makes it 10x easier to manage your schedule and actually achieve your goals

## It's based on 3 main ideas:
 - no minutes wasted in a day
 - everything you do should be going towards a goal you have
 - organizing your day should be frictionless, from from thought to reality

Sparky is able to effortlessly convert text to schedule via LLMs (or manually if you prefer). It knows your priorities and preferences and acts as a personal secretary. Every task in Sparky is assigned to a goal. Goals can be weighted, meaning you can prioritize one goal over the other depending on what you prefer.
